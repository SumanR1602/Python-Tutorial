# if-else Statements
The `if-else` statement in Python is used for decision making. It allows your program to execute certain code only if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified into following types:
- if
- if-else
- if-else-elif
- nested if-else-elif.
## Basic Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # Code block executed if condition is True
else:
    # Code block executed if condition is False
 
```
## Example:
```python
num = 5

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive")
else:
    print("The number is negative or zero")
```
## Output:
```
The number is positive
```
