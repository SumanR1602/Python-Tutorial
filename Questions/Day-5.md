`F = C * 9/5 + 32`

---

## 4. Area of a Rectangle

Ask the user to input the length and width of a rectangle (as strings), convert them to floats, and print the area.

## 5. Even or Odd Checker

Ask the user to enter a number (as a string), convert it to an integer, and print whether it is even or odd.

---

## 6. String Repeater

Ask the user to enter a word and a number (both as strings). Print the word repeated that many times (using the `*` operator).

---

## 7. Simple Interest Calculator

Ask the user for principal, rate, and time (all as strings), convert them to floats, and calculate the simple interest using the formula:  
`Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100`

---

## 8. Last Digit Extractor

Ask the user to enter a number (as a string), convert it to an integer, and print its last digit (using the modulus operator).

---

## 9. Name Formatter

Ask the user to enter their first and last name (as strings). Print their full name in the format:  
`LASTNAME, Firstname`  
(Use string operations and typecasting if needed.)

## 10. Minutes to Hours and Minutes

Ask the user to enter a number of minutes (as a string), convert it to an integer, and print how many hours and minutes it is (e.g., 130 minutes = 2 hours 10 minutes).



## 11. Digit Sum Calculator

Ask the user to enter a positive integer (as a string). Convert it to an integer and print the sum of its digits.  
*(Hint: Use string and int conversion together)*
